Open addressing.

When a new key collides, find next empty slot and put it there.
* Hash map key to integer
* insert. Put at table index i if free.
Use hash function as array index., keep going until we find a empty place.

Keep the cluster small.

Note. Arry size M must be greater than the number of key-value pairs N.
