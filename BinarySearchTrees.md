# 3.2   Binary Search Trees

https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a Comparable key 
(and an associated value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node
is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than 
the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree.

# BST vs Heap 

* `Binary Min Heap for Priority Queue: implicit` 
* `Binary tree: explicit`
