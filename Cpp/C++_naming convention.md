- leading underscore _var
    - It is best practice to NOT use UNDERSCORES before any variable name or parameter name in C++.
Names beginning with an underscore or a double underscore are RESERVED for the C++ implementers. Names with an underscore are reserved for the library to work.

- trailing underscore var_
  - some use trailing underscore for private data members
  - `m_` is more searchable or `l_` to indicate local variables, just some random opinion
In C++, an underscore usually indicates a private member variable.

- The names of variables, constants, and functions are to begin with a lowercase letter.
- The identifier of every globally visible class, enumeration type, type definition, function, constant, and variable in a class library is to begin with a prefix that is uniquefor the library.
- The names of abstract data types, structures, typedefs, and enumerated types are to begin with an uppercase letter.
- In names which consist of more than one word, the words are written together and each word that follows the first is begun with an uppercase letter.
- Do not use identifiers which begin with one or two underscores ('_' or '__').
- A name that begins with an uppercase letter is to appear directly after its prefix.
- A name that begins with a lowercase letter is to be separated from its prefix using an underscore (`_').
- A name is to be separated from its suffix using an underscore (`_').
