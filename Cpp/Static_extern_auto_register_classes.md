C language uses 4 storage classes, namely:
 
 - auto
 
 - extern 

    Variables with “extern” keyword are only declared not defined.
    
    External variables are also known as global variables. These variables are defined outside the function.
    
 - static

  The whole and entire purpose of static is to declare that a variable is private to the source file that it is declared in. T

  Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program. 

- register
