C language uses 4 storage classes, namely:
 
 - auto
 
 - extern 

    Variables with “extern” keyword are only declared not defined.
    
    External variables are also known as global variables. These variables are defined outside the function.
    
 - static
 
   preserving their value even after they are out of their scope!
   Their scope is local to the function to which they were defined. Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program. 

- register
