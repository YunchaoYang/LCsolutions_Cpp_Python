Sphinx is a markup formatting engine / ecosystem, originally developed for documenting the Python programming language.

- Sphinx uses 'reStructuredText', or 'RST' for short. 

- It sits in-between MarkDown and LaTex by power and complexity.

- Sphinx is designed primarily for creating HTML documentation, but can also create static PDFs etc.

RST grammar: 
**bold** and *italics*
星号: *text* 是强调 (斜体),
双星号: **text** 重点强调 (加粗),
反引号: ``text`` 代码样式.

Images syntax is like this:

.. figure::  images/sweat.jpg
   :align:   center

   Proof that getting rich is mostly luck.
