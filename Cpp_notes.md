# Difference C C++
### C++ can be said a superset of C. Major added features in C++ are Object-Oriented Programming, Exception Handling and rich C++ Library.
### C is a function driven language because C is a procedural programming language.	C++ is an object driven language because it is an object oriented programming.
## Namespace is used by C++, which avoid name collisions.

# OOP in C vs C++
C:    struct —> Data                                   —> Variable
C++:  clas  —> (Data variables) + （Member functions)  —> Objecte
Data and functions are separated in C because it is a procedural programming language.	
Data and functions are encapsulated together in form of an object in C++.
