In software engineering, CI/CD or CICD generally refers to the combined practices of 
`continuous integration` and either **continuous delivery** or **continuous deployment**.

# CI
, short for Continuous Integration, is a software development practice in which all developers merge code 
changes in a central repository multiple times a day. CD stands for Continuous Delivery, which on top of
Continuous Integration adds the practice of automating the entire software release process.

# CD 
or Continuous Delivery is the practice of ensuring that code is always in a deployable state. 
This means that all changes to code – new features, bug fixes, experiments, configuration changes 
– are always ready for deployment to a production environment.
The point of CD is to make deployments routine events that can occur at any moment on demand. 
It doesn’t matter if deployment involves a large-scale distributed system, an embedded system, 
or a complex prod environment.

CD can also mean Continuous Deployment – a practice in which all changes are automatically deployed
into production. Unlike Continuous Delivery, there is no final manual approval step before releasing 
into production.

For both these practices, it is important to have the right CI/CD tools in place. 
No CI/CD pipeline can work without the optimal tools.

# What is Agile?
In software development, the term agile refers to a set of frameworks and practices that follow the principles in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. It denotes iterative and incremental methods such as Scrum, Kanban, Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Lean Development and Extreme Programming (XP).

More than anything else, it seeks to facilitate faster delivery times through intense collaboration, iterative feedback cycles and self-organizing cross-functional teams that focus on specific processes and tools tailored to specific tasks.

Agile development focuses most emphatically on collaboration and self-organization. Teams create solutions together and are, for the most part, cross-functional. This means there is no watertight division between teams. For example, testers are just as involved from the beginning as developers. Additionally, each development sprint takes user feedback into account.

Agile testing is ideal for situations in which both business and technical requirements change as the project advances. Since that is how most projects work in the realm of dynamic digital users, agile is one of the most commonly followed development approaches in existence.
